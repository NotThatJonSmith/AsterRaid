video:
starting with the four split screen game is confusing, start with single screen first.
then add four screens
the rotation make it slower


game:
when the screen is gray, cant see you team
seems like it strat is to sit far and snipe
grenade doesn;t go far enough
minions too strong, don't make them convert mercenary turrets
bug: ultimate lets you go thru the gate wall
how is my boost going down when im dead
once a single position is won, the game is over
maybe make turrets do more damage to minions
no reason for increasing respawn
still seems pre determined since the beginning
ultimate laser is good
grenades faster, explosion is instant, and fades
make explosions push players back
respawn, longer for players farther away from game, shorter for short dist
higher instantenous damage, shorter range make it feel better
make minions melee, triple the speed of bullets
idea: more instantenous laser/bullets
