separate indicator for capturing
show cooldown, boost recharge
wall that breaks when the turrets do, or something to block progress past live turrets
feels slow - speed up ships
drone capturing
layer to make minimap more obvious - see progress. Layer above player cameras, visible to orthographic map camera.
