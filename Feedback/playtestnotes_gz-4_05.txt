Tutorial / game script notes:
Shorten whats on there, to be similar to what we were talking about today in class

Game notes:
Letting know the ccotrols, holding down trigger
"How do i change weapons"
The shadows are confusing
Boosting bad button, remap
"Way too many bullets"
Showing healzone?
alot of things going on
Camping behind base still works, need to fix guardians turrets / base placement?
Dominant strategy is still to make a b-line for the base
 - take down the turrets, to bring down the walls
 - Domnion LoL  - when capturing turrets stop attacking/ reduce number of bulletse
Mercenaary turrets kill stealing - "bullshit"
shouldn't collide with your own minions
reduce overall bullets, opt for higher damage bullets
You can't tell you're capturing, color change is too subtle, need a better indicator
Can't capture base while minions keep spawning, maybe stop spawn when itse contested
Indicate for weapon cooldown
moving the camera after death is "weird"
easier to capture a point
"feels really slow" 
Shadows - def remove for bullets / ships, maybe for stage
Make minions weaker/spawn slower
add inhibotors/ sheilds for base

Form notes:
2nd question too early, good q tho
add inhibotors/ sheilds
change a few into multiple choice
make most into long text form
general:
    reorder the questions, from easy/short to long/hard
