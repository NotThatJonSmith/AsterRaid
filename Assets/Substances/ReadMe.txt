Fully adjustable metal material with rust, dirt, scratches and opacity parameters. By using those we are able to create plenty of variations. 
Material allows you to create multiple metal variations such as: steel, chrome, copper etc. Of course every of these can be painted. 
In addition you can use your own normal map which will be used in material generation process. 
You can also use custom image with dynamically tweaked size, rotation and position.
